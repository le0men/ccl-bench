# Tool Development 

## Pipeline

1. Locate target trace under `ccl-bench/trace_collection/<trace_name>`

    Example: `ccl-bench/trace_collection/llama3-8B_torchtitan_perlmutter`

2. Define metrics
    
    Should always include a number (integer, float) that could be presented on the benchmark.
    Other metric format could be collected in addition, such as distribution, or time series.

    Example: number of communication calls for GPU 0 in one iteration

3. Develop tools
    ```
    Input: list[nsys_rep], list[kineto_trace], list[pytorch_et_trace] # stored in trace directory
    Output: float | int
    ```

4. Calculate metrics
